# Tutorial

ðŸš§ *The project is in development and is not available for general public yet.*

Building a [Node.js] application to access [frusal.com] workspace.

There are tutorials for other environments available, see [Angular Tutorial] and [React Tutorial].

In this tutorial we are going to build a simple application using ECMAScript (aka JavaScript), which meant to be running under Node.js. The application would access [frusal.com] workspace, it would create a class (which is like a table in many ways) in the workspace and then write some data to it.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following installed:

- Windows, Linux or macOS
- [Node.js] is an open source JavaScript runtime environment
- [Visual Studio Code] is a popular (among JavaScript developers) and open source IDE

Run the following command in the terminal to make sure node is installed properly:

```txt
$ npm --version
6.14.4
```

Create a new NPM package, with the following commands. It would take you through a series of questions to complete.

```txt
$ mkdir my-first-frusal-access-application
$ cd my-first-frusal-access-application 
$ npm create
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

## Install frusal library

Run the following command to install right library dependency and configure `project.json` and create `frusal.json`. It would take you through a series of questions to complete.

*Note that this initial wizard is only presented if `frusal.json` does not exist.*

```text
$ npx frusal
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
If you are using any source control system like git or svn, you might want to check in any outstanding changes to isolate the changes done by this installation.
Do you want to continue? [yes]: yes

Initialising my-first-frusal-access-application npm project for frusal library which allows to connect to frusal.com workspace.

Please choose library type:
  [1] @frusal/library-for-browser: Bundled library designed to run in a browser with no external dependencies.
  [2] @frusal/library-for-node: Bundled library designed to run under node.js with no external dependencies.
  [3] @frusal/library: Core library with "autobahn" and "rxjs" dependencies.
Library type [1]: 2

Please choose generated source code language:
  [1] ECMAScript (aka JavaScript)
  [2] TypeScript
Source code [1]: 1

Please choose generated source code module loader type:
  [1] ECMAScript 6 Modules (using import statements) *recommended*
  [2] RequireJS (using require() function)
Module loader [1]: 1

Source code model location [.]: .

Installing "frusal" npm dependency...

 * Frusal.com access library is successfully initialised for project my-first-frusal-access-application.
 * Next, please login and start updating your source code stabs and schema declarations.
 * You can use `npm run frusal login`, `npm run frusal update` or `npm run frusal watch` commands.

Please read the note above [ok]: ok
Thank you.
```

</details>

Now, lets login to [frusal.com] with the following command:

```text
$ npx frusal login
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
Frusal login: fred@example.com
Password: 
Please choose a workspace:
  [1] Unit Test
Workspace [1]: 1

CONNECTED to workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test) as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'
```

</details>

## Daily usage

Check the status of the connection and the workspace:

``` text
$ npx frusal status
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
CLI script to install and configure frusal.com workspace access library with static type checking against live schema.

User preferences: /Users/alex/.npm-frusal (first in ancestry)
Base directory: /Users/alex/temp/del-me/my-first-frusal-access-application
Config file: frusal.json
Source code model location: .

CONNECTED to workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test) as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'

Classes in 'My Module':
 - Book
```

</details>

Update (or create, in our case), the local model source code stubs and TypeScript declarations (TSD). The stubs are meant to be taken over by You for further development and maintenance. The TSDs are maintained by `npx frusal` script and used by [Visual Studio Code] IDE for source code static analysis, type validation and auto completion (IntelliSense).

```text
$ npx frusal update
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
Updating schema changes for workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test), connected as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'
Source code model location: .

Updating on 20/04/2020, 5:52:04 pm...

```

</details>

*Have a look at  [`my-module.rt.d.ts`](./my-module.rt.d.ts) and [`my-module.js`](./my-module.js) created. The file names matching the module name as defined at frusal workspace. If there any classes defined at workspace module schema, they would be reflected there.*

We could run the script with `watch` flag to keep schema files up to date in real time:

```text
$ npx frusal watch
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```

</details>

*This could be useful during development. Use ^C to terminate the process.*

## Running

Create __`index.js`__ file with the content you can download from [here](./index.js).

Now, let's try to run it with the following command:

```text
$ node index.js
```
