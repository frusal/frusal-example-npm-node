# Tutorial

ðŸš§ *The project is in development and is not available for general public yet.*

Building a [Node.js] application to access [frusal.com] workspace.

There are tutorials for other environments available, see [Angular Tutorial] and [React Tutorial].

In this tutorial we are going to build a simple application using ECMAScript (aka JavaScript), which meant to be running under Node.js. The application would access [frusal.com] workspace, it would create a class (like a table in may ways) in the workspace and write some data to it.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js] execution environment
- [Visual Studio Code] IDE

Run the following command in the terminal to make sure it is installed properly:

```txt
$ npm --version
6.14.4
```

Create a new NPM package, with the following commands:

```txt
$ mkdir my-first-frusal-access-application
$ cd my-first-frusal-access-application 
$ npm create
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Installing "frusal" npm dependency...

 * Frusal.com access library is successfully initialised for project my-first-frusal-access-application.
 * Next, please login and start updating your source code stabs and schema declarations.
 * You can use `npm run frusal login`, `npm run frusal update` or `npm run frusal watch` commands.

Please read the note above [ok]: ok
Thank you.
```

</details>

Now lets login to frusal.com:

```text
$ npx frusal login
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
Frusal login: unit.test@fruit-salad.tech
Password: 
Please choose a workspace:
  [1] Unit Test
Workspace [1]: 1

CONNECTED to workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test) as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'
```

</details>

Check the status of connection and workspace:

``` text
$ npx frusal status
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
CLI script to install and configure frusal.com workspace access library with static type checking against live schema.

User preferences: /Users/alex/.npm-frusal (first in ancestry)
Base directory: /Users/alex/temp/del-me/my-first-frusal-access-application
Config file: frusal.json
Source code model location: .

CONNECTED to workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test) as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'

Classes in 'My Module':
 - Book
```

</details>

Update (create - in our case), local model source code stubs and TypeScript declarations for [Visual Studio Code] to use for static type checks and code completion (IntelliSense).

```text
$ npx frusal update
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
Updating schema changes for workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test), connected as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'
Source code model location: .

Updating on 20/04/2020, 5:52:04 pm...
  my-module.rt.d.ts
  my-module.js
Done
```

</details>

We can also make it to continue execution, and update the files in real time as soon as the schema changes on frusal.com.

```text
$ npx frusal watch
```

<details><summary>See the console output</summary>

```txt
Watching schema changes at workspace 'Unit Test' (ws_001_unit_test), connected as 'unit.test@fruit-salad.tech'...

^ *This could be useful during development. Simply ^C to terminate this process if you no longer need it.*

Add a copy of `index.js` file which you can download from [here](./index.js).

Let's try to run it:

```text
$ node index.js
```
